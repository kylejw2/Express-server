1. What else can you do with node packages?
    Node packages can be used to incorporate others' libraries of code into your own projects.
2. What else can you do with Express?
    Express, as the developers state on their website, is an unopinionated framework. This means that Express allows me to structure my project as I see fit.
3. What other technologies could you use other than Express?
    I'm not currently aware of other web containers for JavaScript. I do know, however, that there are multiple web containers for Java, such as Apache-Tomcat and RedHat.
4. How is hosting in Express diferent than how you've hosted before?
    Hosting in Express is relatively easier than how I've hosted before, which was through Tomcat and servlets in Java.
